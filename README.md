# sdx-tester

The tester application mimics SDX's interaction with RASRM, EQ and DAP, allowing all the major functionality 
that the SDX project provides to be tested. It is made up of an interactive front-end, unittests and Integration tests.

## Interactions

**SDX-Tester mimics the following interactions**

| External Interaction | Functionality                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RAS-RM               | Puts SEFT survey submissions within `ons-sdx-{{project_id}}-sefts` GCP Bucket and publishes to `seft-topic` PubSub Topic.     |
| RAS-RM               | Acknowledges Receipt sent to RAS-RM via `receipt-topic`                                                                       |

| DAP                  | Subscribes to `dap-topic`, acknowledging processed submissions.                                                               |
| DAP                  | reads data out of `ons-sdx-{{project_id}}-outputs` GCP Bucket                                                                 |
| DAP                  | Publishes to `dap-receipt-topic`, kicking off cleanup cloud function                                                          |
